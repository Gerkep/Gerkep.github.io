       <div class="text">
        <p>I've always wanted to have a muscular physique. Since I was a child I've been training many different sport disciplines, but none of them gave me my dream muscles. I've been also sick of being dependent on my trainers and strict training plans, 
         so about three years ago I've come up with idea to go to the gym and train on my own.</p> 
        <p>At first it wasn't easy, but with time I was becoming stronger and more confident. I started seeing first effects suprisingly fast. Strenght training was giving 
         me a lot of joy. I was progressing rapidly and it was motivating. I liked it so much that I still have motivation to continue my journey with gym. Thanks to that I stay fit and healthy.</p>
        <p>I'd reccomend strenght training for everyone who likes sport and challanges. In my opiinion it's one of the most satisfying sports.</p>
